# MarryMe

MarryMe is an on-chain marriage certificate project build on Sign Protocol. This project is the on-chain attestation version of our existing project [Marry3](https://marry3.love/).

In the real world, if two people in love want to get married, they need to obtain a marriage certificate from a centralized government department. Whether they can get this marriage certificate is determined by the centralized institution, not by the two people in love. In the decentralized network of Web3, we abstract all individuals into addresses. You can choose to marry any one address, and you only need to obtain the other party's consent to obtain your marriage proof, without the need for approval from other third-party centralized institutions. Love is free, equal, and something you can control on your own.
